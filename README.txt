Moment Map Site

What this is
- A warm, intimate two-column layout: the letter on the left, matching "moment" cards on the right.
- Click "Continue" to reveal each paragraph in sequence.
- As each paragraph appears, the matching card highlights.

How to use
1) Open `X25/index.html` in a browser.
2) Edit content in `X25/paragraphs.json`.
   - Letter text lives in `paragraphs.json`.
   - Moment cards live in `why.json`.
3) Customize the look in `Web/styles.css`.

Background image
- The rose texture is `X25/media/rose-texture.jpg`.
- Replace it with another file and update the CSS `background-image` URL if desired.

Why blocks
- Edit `why.json` to update the right-side content and images.
- If the JSON does not load when opening `index.html` directly, run a simple local server.

Paragraphs
- Edit `paragraphs.json` to update the left-side letter text.

Fonts
- Uses Google Fonts: Dancing Script (letter) + Playfair Display (structure).
- If you prefer a different font, tell me the name and I will swap it.
