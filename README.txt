Moment Map Site

What this is
- A warm, intimate two-column layout: the letter on the left, matching "moment" cards on the right.
- Click "Continue" to reveal each paragraph in sequence.
- As each paragraph appears, the matching card highlights.

How to use
1) Open `Web/index.html` in a browser.
2) Edit content in `Web/script.js`.
   - Letter text lives in `letterSections`.
   - Moment cards live in `moments`.
3) Customize the look in `Web/styles.css`.

Background image
- The rose texture is `Web/media/rose-texture.jpg`.
- Replace it with another file and update the CSS `background-image` URL if desired.

Fonts
- Uses Google Fonts: Dancing Script (letter) + Playfair Display (structure).
- If you prefer a different font, tell me the name and I will swap it.
