    "text": "One thing I have come to notice about you is how much you value consistency and effort in the small daily moments, not just the big gestures. You hold on to what matters and you ask for clarity instead of letting things drift. Even when you are tired or stressed, you do not fake it; you want it real, repaired, and steady. You also notice people who are quiet in a room and bring them in. That is a pattern of care I see in you, and it is not loud, but it is constant."

    "key": "moment",
    "text": "There was a night we were fighting and you still said the gratitude line. At the time it felt small, but it stayed with me. It told me you were protecting something about us even when it was hard, and that you were not using the moment to punish me. I did not show up well in that moment, but I remember that you did. It changed how I see the seriousness and the depth of how you commit."

  {
    "key": "impact",
    "text": "Being with you has changed how I carry myself in a relationship. I no longer assume love is understood; I try to show it. I pay more attention to repair and to the ways my silence or logic can land as distance. I hold myself to a higher standard around presence and follow-through, and I can trace that directly to you. You have made me take consistency seriously, not as a rule but as a form of respect."
  },
  {
    "key": "commitment",
    "text": "Looking ahead, one thing I am committed to doing is a daily, specific act of connection that is actually within my control: a 20-second touch and one concrete appreciation before we separate or when we reconnect. This matters to me because I want you to feel seen in the way you have asked for, and I want my actions to match what I say I want. I am not promising a different personality, but I am committing to a steady practice I can keep."
